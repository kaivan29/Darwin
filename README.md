# DARWIN

Write a program to simulate Darwin's World.
Darwin's World contains a two-dimensional grid. Each square in the world can contain at most one creature.
Each creature has three properties: a species, a direction, and a program counter. Each species has a program (a set of instructions).
A creature executes the instruction indicated by the program counter. Each creature is given a turn.

#Testing:

1. Google Test for unit testing
2. gcov for code coverage
3. code profiling with gprof
4. automated documentation with doxygen
5. integration with Travis CI
